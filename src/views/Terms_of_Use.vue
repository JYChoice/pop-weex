                </li>
                <li>Some of the Timerec Services are supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and
                    promotions, and you hereby agree that Timerec may place such advertising and promotions on the

                </li>
                <li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Timerec
                    Services or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, (ii) the
                    posting and use of your Content on or through the Timerec Services does not violate the privacy
                    rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other
                    rights of any person, and (iii) the posting of your Content on the Site does not result in a breach
                    of contract between you and a third party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other
                    monies owing any person by reason of Content you post on or through the Instagram Services.
                </li>
                <li>The Timerec Services contain Content of Timerec ("Timerec Content"). Timerec Content is protected by
                    copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and Timerec owns and retains all rights
                    in the Timerec Content and the Timerec Services. Timerec hereby grants you a limited, revocable,
                    nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the Timerec Content (excluding any software code)
                    solely for your personal use in connection with viewing the Site and using the Timerec Services.
                </li>
                <li>The Timerec Services contain Content of Users and other Timerec licensors. Except as provided within
                    this Agreement, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute,
                    perform, display, or sell any Content appearing on or through the Timerec Services.
                </li>
                <li>Timerec performs technical functions necessary to offer the Timerec Services, including but not
                    limited to transcoding and/or reformatting Content to allow its use throughout the Timerec Services.
                </li>
                <li>Although the Site and other Timerec Services are normally available, there will be occasions when
                    the Site or other Timerec Services will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for
                    emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond the
                    control of Timerec. Also, although Timerec will normally only delete Content that violates this
                    Agreement, Timerec reserves the right to delete any Content for any reason, without prior notice.
                    Deleted content may be stored by Timerec in order to comply with certain legal obligations and is
                    not retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Timerec encourages you to maintain your
                    own backup of your Content. In other words, Timerec is not a backup service. Timerec will not be
                    liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Timerec Services, or the
                    loss of any Content.
